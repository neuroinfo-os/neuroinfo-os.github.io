Thomas Gruber is a trained computer scientist and psychologist. He is an expert in EEG research and
focuses on the problem how the brain orchestrates its cortically widely spaced activity in order to
create unified percepts. In a series of studies, he examined the pivotal role of synchronized neuronal
activity as a solution to this problem during object- and scene-perception (Hassler et al. 2011,
Oppermann et al.,2012, Martens et al., 2011), mnemonic functioning (Daume et al., 2017, Friese et
al, 2013) and -in cooperation with Jutta Müller- language processing (Bonhage et al., 2017). Recently,
the so accumulated expertise is applied within virtual reality settings in order to increase the limited
ecological validity of conventional laboratory experiments (Schöne et al., in press).
He has supervised study projects in cooperation with Nikola Kompa (experimental philosophy, 2012)
and Jutta Müller (development of auditory rule learning, 2013-2015 and artificial grammar learning,
since 2018).
