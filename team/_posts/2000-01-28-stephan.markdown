Achim Stephan is head of the Philosophy of Mind and Cognition group at the Institute of Cognitive Science, to which he belongs since 2001, and co-speaker of the bi-local DFG-funded research training group on Situated Cognition. He studied philosophy, mathematics and psychotherapy & psychosomatics. In his PhD thesis from 1988, he worked on meaning theoretic aspects in the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud; his habilitation thesis from 1998 covers—in a comprehensive way—various theories of emergence and their applications in past and present. His current research is mainly focused on human affectivity, particularly from a situated perspective. From 2012 to 2015, he was president of the German Society for Analytic Philosophy (Gesellschaft für Analytische Philosophie e.V., GAP); since 2017 he is president of the European Philosophical Society for the Study of Emotions (EPSSE).
