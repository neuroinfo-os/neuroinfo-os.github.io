The focus  of professor  Toumaâ€™s research  group is  to generate  and characterise clinically relevant  animal  models  of  inborn  (trait) 
emotionality and stress  reactivity  in  order  to elucidate   neurobiological,   endocrine   and   molecular 
genetic   mechanisms   underlying affective  disorders such  as  major  depression.  It  is  only  with  deep  insight  into  these 
mechanisms   that   novel   treatment   strategies   and   promising   targets   for   therapeutic interventions can be devel
oped in the future. The  spectrum  of  our research includes  projects at  the  genetic,  proteomic  and  systemic 
level. We apply a variety of behavioural tests assessing emotionality, coping and cognitive functions  along  with 
neuroendocrine  approaches  to  analyse neuropeptides and  proteins involved  in the activity  and  regulation  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical  (HPA) axis.   Furthermore, we   use paradigms addressing   the interaction   between   genetic 
predispositions    and    environmental    influences,    shedding    light    on    the    epigenetic 
modification of behavioural traits and neurobiological endophenotypes.
