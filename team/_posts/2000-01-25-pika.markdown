Simone Pika just moved to the University of Osnabrück in Germany to start her own research group on
Comparative Biocognition at the Institute of Cognitive Science. Simone's research centers on the puzzle
of language origins by using the comparative approach with a special focus on communication,
development and underlying cognitive mechanisms. She studies different model systems involving pre-
linguistic human children living in different cultures, non-human primates and corvids. In 2010, Simone
received a Sofja Kovalevkaja Award of the Humboldt Foundation to tackle 'gestural compexity across
species and taxa' and in 2017 an ERC-Consolidator Grant to study 'The evolution and development of
turn-taking’. She held group leader positions, assistant professor positions or research positions at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, the Max Planck Institute for the Science
of Human History in Jena, the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen Germany, the
University of Manchester in Manchester UK, the University of St. Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland, and
the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.
