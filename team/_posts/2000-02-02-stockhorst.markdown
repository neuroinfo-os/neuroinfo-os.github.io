Our research focuses on "Brain, Hormones and Behavior".

An important aspect that we wish to cover in our human-experimental studies is interdisciplinary research connecting biology, medicine (endocrinology, anesthesiology, gynecology) and neurosciences. The hormones predominantly studied are stress hormones, sex hormones and insulin. The paradigms employed are classical conditioning, stress paradigms as well as dispositions for the detection of odor and taste perception.
