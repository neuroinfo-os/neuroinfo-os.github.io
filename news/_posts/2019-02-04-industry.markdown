Can Germany survive without Artificial Intelligence? This is the question being discussed at the joint event organized by the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uos.de) and the economy and industry club Osnabrück ([Wirtschafts- und Industrie-Klub Osnabrück](https://wiklub-os.de/)). The public event takes place on Tuesday, Feburary 12, at 18:00 in the palace of Osnabrück (Neuer Graben 29, 49074 Osnabrück). Entrance is free, but registration (via [Internet](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~imc/) or Phone: 0541-776828) is required.

The event will discuss the question whether and to what extent progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence can counteract the shortage of skilled labor and the weakness of economic growth. Already today many of us experience the effects of Artificial Intelligence as both dangerous and potentially helpful.

After some introductory words by the organizers and the minister for science and culture in Lower Saxony, Björn Thümler, the topic of Artificial Intelligence is discussed by various experts from different points of view. After the short talks, a number of topic tables invite further discussions among the participants about selected aspects of the overall topic.
